These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.\nTypically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the \"Neolithic Period\", the \"Ming Dynasty\" or the \"McCarthy Era\". There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nThere are two different conceptualisations of 'artistic style', defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, \"Impressionism\" can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic\n- European Bronze Age\n- Italian Renaissance\n- Thirty Years War\n- Sturm und Drang\n- Cubism","superClassUris":[{"scheme":"http","path":"/120111/E2_Temporal_Entity","query":null,"fragment":null,"authority":"erlangen-crm.org","userinfo":null,"user":null,"password":null,"host":"erlangen-crm.org","port":null}],"subClassUris":[{"scheme":"http","path":"/120111/E5_Event","query":null,"fragment":null,"authority":"erlangen-crm.org","userinfo":null,"user":null,"password":null,"host":"erlangen-crm.org","port":null}],"nounPhraseConstituents":[{"modifiers":[],"head":"Phase"}]}}

Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an 'instantaneous' change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period.

The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P4 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as \"preferred identifier assignment\", to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.\n\nExamples:\n- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- assigning the author-uniform title heading \"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.Faust. 1.

In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring\n- the place referred to in the phrase: \"Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone\"\n- Here -\u003e \u003c-","superClassUris":[{"scheme":"http","path":"/120111/E1_CRM_Entity","query":null,"fragment":null,"authority":"erlangen-crm.org","userinfo":null,"user":null,"password":null,"host":"erlangen-crm.org","port":null}],"subClassUris":[],"nounPhraseConstituents":[{"modifiers":[],"head":"Ort"}]}}

The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Stonehenge\n- the hole in the ozone layer\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics\n- the Bermuda Triangle","superClassUris":[{"scheme":"http","path":"/120111/E1_CRM_Entity","query":null,"fragment":null,"authority":"erlangen-crm.org","userinfo":null,"user":null,"password":null,"host":"erlangen-crm.org","port":null}],"subClassUris":[{"scheme":"http","path":"/120111/E39_Actor","query":null,"fragment":null,"authority":"erlangen-crm.org","userinfo":null,"user":null,"password":null,"host":"erlangen-crm.org","port":null},{"scheme":"http","path":"/120111/E70_Thing","query":null,"fragment":null,"authority":"erlangen-crm.org","userinfo":null,"user":null,"password":null,"host":"erlangen-crm.org","port":null}],"nounPhraseConstituents":[{"modifiers":[],"head":"Seiendes"}]}}
